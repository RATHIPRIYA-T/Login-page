Creating a login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves structuring the page, styling it, and adding functionality for user interaction and validation. Hereâ€™s a brief description:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is used to create the structure of the login page. It includes the form elements such as text inputs for the username and password, and a submit button. The form also contains a container to display error messages.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used to style the login page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. It defines the layout, spacing, font styles, and colors. CSS also ensures that the form is centered on the page and that the elements are properly aligned and spaced.

JavaScript:
JavaScript adds interactivity and client-side validation to the login page. It includes an event listener for the form submission, which prevents the default form submission behavior and checks if the entered username and password match the predefined values. If the credentials are correct, a success message is shown; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
This combination ensures that the login page is not only functional but also provides a good user experience with immediate feedback on input errors.
